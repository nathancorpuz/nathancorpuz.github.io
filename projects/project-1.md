I created a game where the player goes to a circus and gets to interact with the different stalls. The player gets to choose between feeding a tiger or knocking down a pin with a rock. For each event, the player also gets to choose the total food/power used when playing which allows for multiple possibilities. This project was created using the application "Alice 3", which is a program that acted as an introduction to Java Programming. It helped introduce me to the basic programming concepts such as data types, objects, variables, arrays, loops, etc. 

I found the process in making the game a fun experience as I had all the freedom to make anything I desired. Making the game ultimately led to me wanting to major in Computer Science. 

Source code for this project will be made available soon.
