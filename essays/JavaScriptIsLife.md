Prior to ICS 314, I had zero experience working with Javascript. After completing the freecodecamp introduction to Javascript, my interest in the Javascript programming language suddenly went up. I learned that one of the main uses of JavaScript is to develop web, mobile, and game apps. All of which I have an interest of pursuing a career out of. 

## Initial Impression
My initial impression of JavaScipt is that it's really convinient to be able to write, test, and run code via a browser. Using websites such as jsfiddle.net, also allows for us to share code by sharing a URL. This saves a lot of hassle and time from having to upload a file in order to share it with others. 


## Cool Features
Javascript provides an easier way of writing functions in comparison to Java. A lot of the code requires less keywords. It kind of feels like im just writing pseudocode compared to the other programming languages I experienced with. Using FreeCodeCamp, I was able to learn pretty much everything I learned about in Java but in the span of a few hours. In my opinion, picking up JavaScript is well worth it.


## Practicing JavaScript
Currently practicing the WOD's for the course are pretty fun. Unfortunately, I messed up on today's WOD as I couldn't find what line of code I was missing. I was able to figure it out after running out of time so hopefully I will be better prepared for the next WOD. In addition, the solution professor Moore showed afterwards made me realize my code could have been improved by using helper functions. It is quite exciting learning new tricks for JavaScript.
