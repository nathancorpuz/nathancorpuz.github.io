## Web Design
One of the sections of computer science I find the most interesting is web design. 
Web design is a skill that is starting to become more main stream as internet/technology containues to grow. 
We even have more people starting to create their own businesses. 
More businesses means more companies wanting their own websites. 
To learn how to web design, we first dive into using HTML and CSS. 
Learning HTML and CSS is similar to learning a new programming language as it takes some time and effort to be comfortable working with it.
