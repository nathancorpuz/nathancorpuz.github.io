## A different IDE (IntelliJ)
Recently, we started using a new IDE for coding by using the program IntelliJ. IntelliJ is an IDE similar to programs such as Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, etc. One of the positives of using IntelliJ over the other IDE's is that the simplicity of the program makes it beginner friendly. It allows us to combine the use of the program with other programs such as GitHub. THis makes it easier to upload/share code with anyone. It also gives us the option to select which plugins we want to have access to when we run IntelliJ. 

## The benefits of coding standards
Using IntelliJ, we are also learning new coding standards.
