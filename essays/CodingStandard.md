## A different IDE (IntelliJ)
Recently, we started using a new IDE for coding by using the program IntelliJ. IntelliJ is an IDE similar to programs such as Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, etc. One of the positives of using IntelliJ over the other IDE's is that the simplicity of the program makes it beginner friendly. It allows us to combine the use of the program with other programs such as GitHub. THis makes it easier to upload/share code with anyone. It also gives us the option to select which plugins we want to have access to when we run IntelliJ. 

## The benefits of coding standards
Using IntelliJ, we are also learning new coding standards. Reasons we want to follow coding standards is to keep the code's readability as clean as possible. We want it as readable as possible so anyone could be able to look at your code and be able to follow as the format remains the same. Though learning new coding standards takes some time to figure out, there is a simple way in reaching coding standards.

## Obtaining the green check!
The new tool we are using to inspect JavaScript code is called ESLint. ESLint is great at inspecting code and finding the warnings/errors in code. As a beginner in JavaScript, I have yet to learn the coding standards to the point where I can follow it without relying on ESLint. After finishing writing my code, ESLint usually finds a bunch of warnings and errors. The warnings and errors can be as simple as a missing space in the code. It was a pain fixing them individually, but recently learned that IntelliJ provides an automated way to fix all the warnings/errors in one click by using the alt+enter hotkey. Making it real simple to obtain the green check for correct codings standards.
