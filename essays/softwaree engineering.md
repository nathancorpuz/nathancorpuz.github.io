Software Engineering is one of the most creative things you can do with computer programming. The main appeal I find in software Engineering is the quality of life changes it can provide to people. 


## Interests
My main interests in software engineering is to be able to learn and create game apps for mobile or web. I have a big interest in game development because of the freedom to make any kind of game I want which can only be limited by my imagination. I also have an interest in mobile app devopment as I have a few ideas of applications I wish existed on the app store for iPhone. 


## Developing in the Future
I hope to develop my proficiency with the JavaScript programming language. So far I am enjoying learning JavaScript mainly because the keywords for this language just makes the code alot easier to read anhd understand, especially when I am reading code written by someone else. The main experience I want to learn from this course is the process of making a software so that I can create my own apps in the future.
