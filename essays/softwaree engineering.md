Prior to ICS 314, I had zero experience working with Javascript. After completing the freecodecamp introduction to Javascript, my interest in the Javascript programming language suddenly went up. I learned that one of the main uses of JavaScript is to develop web, mobile, and game apps. All of which I have an interest of pursuing a career out of. 

## Initial Impression
My initial impression of JavaScipt is that it's really convinient to be able to write, test, and run code via a browser. Using websites such as jsfiddle.net, also allows for us to share code by sharing a URL. This saves a lot of hassle and time from having to upload a file in order to share it with others.
