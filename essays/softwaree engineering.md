Software Engineering is one of the most creative things you can do with computer programming. The main appeal I find in software Engineering is the quality of life changes it can provide to people. Software such as phone applicaitons and computer applications is constantly being utilized by people as technology continues to grow. Software allows for quality of life changes that makes life easier and convinient. Apps such as the clock, calculator, notes, games, etc. that can be found on your very own phone.


## Interests
My main interests in software engineering is to be able to learn and create game apps for mobile or web. I have a big interest in game development because of the freedom to make any kind of game I want which can only be limited by my imagination. I also have an interest in mobile app devopment as I have a few ideas of applications I wish existed on the app store for the iPhone. 


## Developing in the Future
I hope to develop my proficiency with the JavaScript programming language. So far I am enjoying learning JavaScript mainly because the keywords for this language just makes the code alot easier to read and understand, especially when I am reading code written by someone else. The main experience I want to learn from this course is the process of creating a software so that I can create my own apps in the near future.
