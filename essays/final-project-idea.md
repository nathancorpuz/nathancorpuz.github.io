# Project: Group Finder

## Overview

_The problem:_ Many UH students have passion projects they would like to create. However, they are
unable to find other students to work with.

_The solution:_ The Group Finder application allows students to login and create a profile indicating
their project ideas and specialties. The profile canalso include links to existing project files (Google
Drives, GitHub, etc.).

## Approach

Once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles and project listings filtered by specialties,
capabilities, and goals to find compatible students to contact.

Students can also set up notifications to find out automatically when a project listing is created that
satisfies criteria that they specify.

Admins can monitor the site for inappropriate content,and create new categories of user specialties,
project criteria, and goals.

Some mockup pages include:


- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin home page
- User profile page.
- Browse projects by user, criteria, goals, etc.

## Use case ideas

Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show
an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

User:
- New user gets onto website and is directed to complete their profile
- They then search relevant projects or create their own
- Users then message others via the messaging system

Admin:
- Admin logs in and can edit site

## Beyond the basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

- Messaging between users.
- Finished project reviews.
- Networking history between users.
- Paid projects (for premium users).
- PSA messages by admins
